component based architecture
to comunication between components we have 3 ways
1) props

    parent to child component communication

what is props?
1) props is a object
2) props is a read only object
3) props is a uni-directional flow
4) props is a way to pass data from parent to child component


limitations of props
a-->b-->c*

props drilling

---------------------------


virtual dom:
dom:document object model

original > copy > light weight copy > virtual dom

if any changes in virtual dom then only it will update in original dom

hook: any builtin or lifecycle method in functional component
useState:

2) context
3) redux


component --> comp --> urls
react-router-dom
<BrowseRouter>
<Routes>
        <Route></Route>
</Routes>
</BrowseRouter> ---> enable routes in your react application



handleSubmmit = (cb)=>{

    //register.. input... states... name email age...
    obj = {

        name:this.state.name,
        email:this.state.email,
        age:this.state.age
    }

    cb(obj)


}
